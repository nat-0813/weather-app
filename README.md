# weather-app
 weather app project in class
Overall, this code sets up a server that accepts a city name and state as input, makes API calls to retrieve weather information, and responds with the temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather. The HTML form in page.html allows users to enter the city and state, and the weather information is displayed in the response.
